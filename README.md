# Zephyr port to riscv32 architecture
The Zephyr Project is a small, scalable real-time operating system for use on resource-constrained systems supporting multiple architectures.

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture.

This repository provides a port of Zephyr for the riscv32 architecture. Following the zephyr architecture, the port has been splitted into
three parts:
- riscv32 architecture support
- riscv32-based SOC support
- riscv32 board support

riscv32 architecture support is a generic riscv port for handling boot, interrupts/exceptions/fault and context-switching.

The riscv32-based SOC support accounts for SOC-specific:
- system layout
- interrupt handling
- bit manipulation operations
- atomic operations
- peripheral/bus support, such as, timer,  uart, gpio, i2c, spi, etc

The riscv32 board support characterizes the configuration of a given riscv32-based SOC for a particular board. For example,
`zedboard_pulpino` is a configuration of the `pulpino-soc` for the `zedboard`.

`zephyr-riscv` currently handles the following SOCs:
- riscv32-qemu, supporting the sifive machine model
- pulpino
- SiFive Freedom E310

The riscv32 port has successfully been merged into the Zephyr Project master repository at https://gerrit.zephyrproject.org and shall be released in Zephyr 1.7. **The SiFive FE310 SOC port is available only in the zephyr-riscv github repository for the time being.**

The riscv toolchain (gcc, binutils, gdb) and riscv-qemu have successfully been merged into the zephyr SDK and has been released in the 0.9 SDK version.
The 0.9 SDK binary can be obtained from the following link:

https://nexus.zephyrproject.org/content/repositories/releases/org/zephyrproject/zephyr-sdk/0.9/zephyr-sdk-0.9-setup.run

## Getting and setting `zephyr-riscv` build environment
Requirements:

either

- zephyr-sdk-0.9

or
- latest `riscv-gnu-toolchain` compiled for riscv32 
- latest `riscv-qemu` supporting the sifive machine model

If you want to compile your own toolchain and riscv-qemu, follow the steps below:

### Getting and compiling the `riscv-gnu-toolchain`
```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/fractalclone/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
$ cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-xlen=32 --with-arch=RV32IMAFD
$ sudo make -j
```
After compilation, the `riscv-gnu-toolchain` shall be found at `/opt/riscv`

### Getting and compiling `riscv-qemu`
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu
$ cd riscv-qemu
$ git submodule update --init pixman
$ ./configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu,riscv32-softmmu --prefix=/opt/riscv
$ make -j
$ sudo make install
```
After compilation, `qemu-system-riscv32` shall be found at `/opt/riscv/bin`

### Installing the zephyr-SDK (preferred)
If you will use the zephyr-0.9-sdk, install it as follows:
```sh
$ chmod +x zephyr-sdk-0.9-setup.run
$ sudo ./zephyr-sdk-0.9-setup.run
```
After installation, the zephyr-SDK shall be found in `/opt/zephyr-sdk` (if the default target directory for the SDK has been chosen during the installation process).

### Getting the `zephyr-riscv` sources
Since riscv support is now available in the Zephyr Project master repository, you can either get the zephyr sources from the 
from the zephyr-riscv github repository or from Zephyr Project master repository as follows:

Github repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fractalclone/zephyr-riscv.git
$ cd zephyr-riscv
```
Zephyr Project master repository
```sh
$ git clone https://gerrit.zephyrproject.org/r/zephyr zephyr-riscv
$ cd zephyr-riscv
```
### Setting zephyr build environment
Within the `zephyr-riscv` directory, setup the zephyr environment variables as follows:
```sh
$ source zephyr-env.sh
```
#### Settings to compile zephyr using the zephyr-sdk
To compile zephyr using the zephyr-sdk, export the following environment variables:
```sh
$ export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/zephyr-sdk
$ export ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT=zephyr
```
#### Settings to compile zephyr using an external `riscv-gnu-toolchain`
If you want to use an external `riscv-gnu-toolchain`, configure zephyr to use the `riscv-gnu-toolchain` by exporting the following environment variables:
```sh
$ export RISCV32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/riscv-toolchain
$ export ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT=riscv32
```
## Compiling `zephyr-riscv` for the `qemu_riscv32` board
### Compile and run the `philosophers` sample app for the `qemu_riscv32` board using the zephyr-sdk
```sh
$ cd samples/philosophers
$ make BOARD=qemu_riscv32 run
```
The command shall compile and run the `philosophers` application using the `qemu-system-riscv32` found in the zephyr-sdk.

To exit qemu, press `Ctrl-a x`

### Compile only the `philosophers` sample app for the `qemu_riscv32` board
```sh
$ cd samples/philosophers
$ make BOARD=qemu_riscv32
```
Once compiled, the `zephyr.elf` file shall be found at `outdir/qemu_riscv32/zephyr.elf`

### Running 'zephyr.elf' using an external `qemu-system-riscv32`
Within the `philosophers` directory:
```sh
$ /path/to/qemu-system-riscv32 -kernel outdir/qemu_riscv32/zephyr.elf -m 32 -machine sifive -nographic
```
To exit qemu, press `Ctrl-a x`

## Compiling `zephyr-riscv` for the `zedboard_pulpino` board
Compiling the zephyr for pulpino will require either:
- the zephyr-sdk-0.9, or
- a riscv-gnu-toolchain compiled from sources at https://github.com/fractalclone/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git, or
- the pulpino-specific toolchain at https://github.com/pulp-platform/ri5cy_gnu_toolchain

The zephyr-sdk-0.9 has a patch that allows the pulpino-specific code to be compiled with the latest `riscv-gnu-toolchain`. Using an unpatched generic `riscv-gnu-toolchain` won't work. This is due to the fact that the `eret` opcode required by pulpino has been removed in the latest `riscv-gnu-toolchain`.

It is also to be noted that, within the latest `riscv-gnu-toolchain`, the `wfi` opcode encoding has changed from 0x10200073 to 0x10500073. However, pulpino only understands 0x10200073 and will generate an illegal instruction fault when trying to execute 0x10500073. Moreover, 0x10200073 is now used to encode the `sret` opcode. For this reason, the port of zephyr to riscv32 architecture comprises a `CONFIG_RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN` config variable, which when set, will replace `wfi` by `sret` within the pulpino-specific code. 

### Compiling a sample app for the `zedboard_pulpino` board using the zephyr-sdk
Assuming that the zephyr-sdk environment variables have already been set, compiling the `philosophers` sample app is performed as follows within the `philosophers` directory:
```sh
$ make BOARD=zedboard_pulpino
```
After compilation, the `zephyr.s19` file required by pulpino will be found at `outdir/zedboard_pulpino/zephyr.s19`

Within the `philosophers` directory, convert the `zephyr.s19` to a `spi_stim.txt` file using the utility found at https://github.com/fractalclone/riscv-binaries/blob/master/pulpino/s19toslm.py as follows:
```sh
$ /path/to/s19toslm.py outdir/zedboard_pulpino/zephyr.s19
```
The `spi_stim.txt` will be generated inside the `philosophers` directory. 

Follow the instructions given at https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino/tree/master/fpga to setup the zedboard for running the pulpino core. 

Once you have a zedboard running linux and the pulpino fpga bitstream, transfer the `spi_stim.txt` file as well as the `spiload` application to the zedboard. (a precompiled version of the `spiload` app can be obtained at https://github.com/fractalclone/riscv-binaries/blob/master/pulpino/spiload)

Once copied, use the `spiload` application to load the `spi_stim.txt` firmware to the pulpino core as follows:
```sh
$ ./spiload -t10000 spi_stim.txt
```
You can also test the `samples/basic/disco_fever`, `samples/basic/blinky`, `samples/basic/button` and `samples/basic/disco` apps for pulpino.

### Compiling a sample app for the `zedboard_pulpino` board using the pulpino-specific toolchain
To compile a sample app for the `zedboard_pulpino` board using the pulpino-specific toolchain, one must first add the following `CONFIG_RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN=n` in the `prj.conf` file found within the sample app directory. This shall allow zephyr to account for pulpino-specific opcodes, like bit-manipulation, and prevent the replacement of `wfi` by `sret`.
Example, within the `philosophers` directory:

Add the `CONFIG_RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN=n` to the `prj.conf` file, if not already set
```sh
$ echo "CONFIG_RISCV_GENERIC_TOOLCHAIN=n" >> prj.conf
```
Configure zephyr to use the pulpino-specific toolchain by exporting the following environment variables:
```sh
$ export RISCV32_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/ri5cy_gnu_toolchain/install
$ export ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT=riscv32
```

Compile the philosophers application for the `zedboard_pulpino` board
```sh
make BOARD=zedboard_pulpino
```
### Compiling the `philosophers` sample app for the `arty_fe310` board
Assuming that the zephyr-sdk environment variables have already been set, compiling the `philosophers` sample app for the `arty_fe310` board is performed as follows within the `philosophers` directory:
```sh
$ make BOARD=arty_fe310
```
After compilation, the `zephyr.elf` binary will be found at `outdir/arty_fe310/zephyr.elf`

### Loading the `zephyr.elf` binary on the arty board
The following assumes that you already have an arty fpga board (https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty/start) running the SiFive FE310 SOC. If not, register yourself to the sifive developer's website (https://dev.sifive.com) to get the SiFive FE310 FPGA bitstream for the arty board and get info about how to:
- flash the SiFive FE310 bitstream on the arty board
- connect the olimex ARM-USB-TINY JTAG to the arty board (https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-TINY) to flash riscv32 binaries
- get started with the arty board running the SiFive FE310 SOC

To load the `zephyr.elf` image on the arty board you will require:
- the Sifive `freedom-e-sdk` available at https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk. More specifically, the `openocd` tool available within the `freedom-e-sdk`. 
- the olimex ARM-USB-TINY JTAG to flash the `zephyr.elf` image on the arty board.

Once you've compiled the tools available in the `freedom-e-sdk`, the `openocd` binary will be found at `/path/to/freedom-e-sdk/toolchain/bin/openocd`

To flash the `zephyr.elf` on the arty board do the following:
- ensure that the olimex ARM-USB-TINY JTAG is connected to your PC and the arty board
- ensure that the arty board is powered on
- extend the `PATH` variable with the `freedom-e-sdk/toolchain/bin` directory as follows:
  ```sh
  export PATH=/path/to/freedom-e-sdk/toolchain/bin:$PATH
  ```
- load the `zephyr.elf` using the `freedom-e-sdk` utility script `openocd_upload.sh` as follows:

Assuming that you are in the `philosophers` directory
  ```sh
  /path/to/freedom-e-sdk/bsp/tools/openocd_upload.sh \
  outdir/arty_fe310/zephyr.elf \
  /path/to/freedom-e-sdk/bsp/env/freedom-e300-arty/openocd.cfg
  ```
Upon successful load, you should see the philosophers application running in the arty board UART console.
You can also test the `samples/basic/disco_fever` (to increase or decrease LEDS blink speed, press respectively BTN0 or BTN1 on the arty board), `samples/basic/blinky`, `samples/basic/button` (press BTN0 on arty board), `samples/basic/disco` and `samples/shell` apps for the `arty_fe310` board.
